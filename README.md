# HtA-Lovesick-MP

Initial Release, still needs more optimizations done to make the game run less like shit (remove unneeded tags, consolidate religions) but it should be mostly playable now.

Based on Demonade's MP HtA edit and specifically the Dempsey edit, the mod is intended to make HtA actually fucking playable in MP by fixing the fucked Eco and balancing it out to make the gameplay more interesting.

The initial releases will focus on stability and some minor changes to promote healthier gameplay, later the mod will shift into adding new decisions, events, and paths for nations to flesh them out even more.

Summary of Changes:
* Fixed Dempsey's half-hearted attempt to add a world bank which lead to eco being dogshit.
* Fixed Ghost Nation so it actually works for all the new tags.
* Genocided the remaining China pops who didn't get caught in the initial Demonade pass
* Rebalanced RGOs and Factories around the world, took notes from PUIR and also some DoD mods to spread RGOs out so relevant nations aren't completely cucked. Production should be comparable to PUIR levels of important goods.
  * Added Tech to relevant nations so the entire world doesn't start without fucking railroads or cheap coal. This drastically improved the eco and probably was the biggest issue with the vanilla mod.
* Rebalanced the German nations slightly, total amount of craftsmen reduced in the German Region but it should be slightly more even between the contenders vs Berlin still having 60k Craftsmen without a single factory.
  * Removed German Minor cores except for Oldenburg (Cores on Netherland's German land to release if they want to give up on Germany), Rhineland, Lusatia, and DAU which has cores over Swiss lands.
* Removed unneeded events like the ebin chinese civil war.
* Pop rebalances: Slight buff to nu-world since they start depopulated as fuck in this mod (15%). Nerf Japanese starting Pop (-20%, puts them even with most mods). Gave Japan the Persian Conquest RP nerf (-25% conquest RP)
  > World should be moderately industrialized now but will still be less industrialized than most mods. Artisans pick up the slack though.
* Added starting Spheres where they made sense or influence so a country can get sphered quickly if the player wants to.
* Added Treaty Ports
  * Made the Dutch's Treaty Port in Japan an actual Treaty Port so they have a reason to hold onto it. If Japan takes it back the treaty port is destroyed though, although they get a buff for doing so.
* Redid some ugly ass region borders.
* Removed all the retarded African cores in uncolonized provinces.
* Added missing colonies in Afrika (starting colonies) from the original mod.
* Rebalanced Russia and Smolensk a lot.
	* Debuff during Civil War which makes it more painful even if you fight AI. Goes away after the war ends and you form.
	* Fixed issues with Smolensk not getting any of the decisions or events Russia should.
	* Rebalanced Ugrian Pop spread so there's about the same amount of them as Tartar
	* RUS can't get Tartar anymore so which nation wins will affect your accepted, but both should be about even due to the above.
	* To make up for the above they get even better RGOS
* "Nerfed" Scandinavia by removing Ugrian and giving them Lithuanian and Prussian instead.
  >Technically a nerf but really more of a 'now there's actually a reason to roster this nation' as now Russia has an incentive to help them.
